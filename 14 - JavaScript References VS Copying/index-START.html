    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team1 = players;
    team1[2] = 'pual';
    console.log(team1);
    console.log(players);


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2] = 'soap';
    console.log(team2);
    console.log(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'sue';
    console.log(team3);
    console.log(players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4.push('mam');
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[1] = 'dad';
    console.log(team5);
    console.log(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
   
    // captain.number = '99';
    // console.log(person);
    // console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.number = 13;
    console.log(cap3);
    console.log(person);
    console.clear();

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const soap = {
      name: 'Sophie',
      age: 27,
      home: {
        country: 'Canada',
        city: 'Ottawa'
      }
    }

    const copy = {...soap};

    copy.home.country = 'USA';
    console.log(soap);
    console.log(copy);
    //Both have changed to USA because the spread (and Object.assign) are only one layer deep, so the nested objects are not copied but referenced. 
    
    // HACKY WAY OF SOLVING(poor mans deep clone):
    const copy2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(soap));
    copy2.home.country = 'Australia';
    console.log(copy2);
    console.log(soap);
